      <p>Using multiple sites across the island of Oahu, the Hawaii VINE (Vertebrate Introductions and Novel Ecosystems) Project examines how the structure and dynamics of seed dispersal networks vary across ecological contexts. This phase of the project is manipulating fruit resources in a novel ecosystem to understand the mechanisms of community stability, resilience and recovery. Across three sites in the Wai'anae Mountain Range our team is collecting data on the avian frugivore network through avian banding, fecal and blood sample collectiongs, fruit sampling, and vegetation sampling.<br>

      I acknowledge that Hawaiʻi is an indigenous space where the descendants of the original people are today identified as Kānaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian). I recognize that it was through coercion, force, and the breaking of formal treaties that this land was illegally seized. I recognize my privelege to work on the mokupuni (island) of Oʻahu, in the Pae ʻĀina o Hawaiʻi (Hawaiian archipelago) and express sincere gratitude for the opportunity to learn from generations of Aboriginal Hawaiians and their knowledge systems that have shaped and continue to shape Hawaiʻi in a sustainable way that allows us to learn here today. <br>

      <p>Seed dispersal is a critical mutualistic relationship that drives system stability, biodiversity, and regeneration post-disturbance. My Ph.D. work focuses on the mechanisms that drive successful seed dispersal on O'ahu, Hawai'i. The seed dispersal network on O'ahu is novel in which the fruiting plant species and non-native frugivores did not evolve together, which provides a ripe opportunity to test what mechanisms drive successful dispersal. I am actively collecting field work to answer the following questions: <br>
      (1) How do birds find fruit? Testing the mechanisms of the spatiotemporal overlap between available fruit and avian frugivores. <br>
      (2) Competitive Eavesdropping: Are frugivorous competitors cueing into the soundscape to increase frugivory success? <br>
      (3) Estimating maximum seed dispersal distances <br>
      (4) How do abiotic factors and scarification influence germinability, seedling growth rates, and seedling survival in a dispersal dependent system? Projections under future climate scenarios.<br>
      (5) How effective are seed dispersers? Using empirical data to measure Seed Dispersal Effectiveness for a Hawaiian seed dispersal network.</p>
