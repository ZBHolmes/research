      <h1>Welcome, I'm Zach</h1>
      <p>​I am a motivated and passionate professional in the field of avian ecology and conservation. In May 2024 I graduated with a M.Sc. degree from the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the University of Florida, and in August of 2024 started a Ph.D. in the Department of Zoology and Physiology at the University of Wyoming. My research interests generally encompass landscape and population ecology, plant-animal interactions, habitat management, and endangered species ecology using birds as a focal taxa. My career goals are to aid avian species conservation efforts through research and science communication. My M.Sc. research was applied in nature and focused on how avian use varied across pasture types and management strategies on south-central Florida rangelands. Comparatively, my Ph.D. will be understanding plant-animal interactions and resource tracking behavior. I am studying seed-dispersal networks and avian behavior on O'ahu, Hawaii. Outside of academia I have worked for state agencies, research stations, and private consultant firms; gaining experience with various stakeholders and project goals. I actively contribute to increasing accessibility and diversity in this field through scientific communication and advocacy across agencies and institutions. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or interests in collaborating.</p>
