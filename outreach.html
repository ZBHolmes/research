  <h1>Community Engagement and Scientific Communication</h1>
   <p> I am committed to increasing accesibility to ecology, science, and field work to anyone that is interested in learning more about ecology, birds, or the natural world. If you are interested in joining me on this mission or want to learn more about how I do this read more below. Please reach out to me via email or instagram if I can help in any way.</p>

      <p>
        Serving on council and standing committees allows me to ensure that student perspectives are being heard by the AOS leadership while also increasing the transparency of AOS intiatives. As leader of the Student Affairs Committee I am helping plan events and opportunities to increase scientific communication and opportunities for all students pursuing ornithology or avian ecology. As part of the Meeting Coordination Committee I am the leader of the Volunteers Sub-Committee, Co-Chair of the BRIDGE/DEI Sub-Committee, and a member of the SAFE sub-committee. In these roles I ensure students receive registration discounts in exchange for volunteering for to increase conference success, handle and advocate for DEI related issues including spanish translations and accessibility concerns, and ensure the conference every year is productive and safe for all.

    <h2>The FLOCKS Project</h2>

    <p>
     The FLOCKS project is an inter-society initiative between the American Ornithological Society, the Wilson Ornithological Society, and the Association of Field Ornithologists. Through this initiative we are increasing accessibility, community, and access to all ornithologists regardless of background and identity. 
    </p>

      <p>
        The FLOCKS project currently consists of 6 groups ("flocks"). I currently serve as the chair of the Rainbow Flock, a group whose mission is to increase community, safety, and networking opportunities for queer identifying ornithologists throughout our three host societies. We strive to ensure clear communication to our flock members about upcoming opportunities and news that may impact them. Further we are actively planning in-person events at upcoming annual conferences and remotely throughout the year via zoom. If you are interested in learning more about our host societies, the FLOCKS project, or how to get more involved please see the links below. <br><br>

    <h2> Graduate Student Council</h2>

    <p>
     At the University of Wyoming I serve as one of the student representative for the College of Agricultural, Life Sciences and Natural Resources on the Graduate Student Council. We work to ensure graduate students needs, perspectives, and concerns are met at a University wide level.

      <p>
        Graduate students serve as the driving force for academic research and publications. However, in many universities graduate students are not represented by student government, faculty, or staff in university wide decisions and policies. At the University of Wyoming I helped start and continue to help run the Graduate Student Council, a recognized student organization that works to understand graduate student needs, vote on policies and stances that can affect graduate students workplace and life, and be proactive in our ability to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of graduate students in the workplace. Our mission is to be a voice for graduate students at the University of Wyoming. If you are interested in discussing initiatives like this on your campus, please reach out.

    <h2>Bird Banding Workshops and Community Engagement</h2>

    <p>
     Bird banding and handling is an important skill for the field of ornithology and avian conservation. I have been incredibly fortunate to lead bird banding workshops, public presentations, and mentor volunteers and technicians across four states: Florida, Oregon, Wyoming, and Hawai'i.
    </p>

      <p>
        Using passive and active mist netting techniques, walk-in traps, and funnel traps I have handled passerines, near-passerines, and small birds of prey throughout my career. I have really enjoyed passing on my knowledge during bird banding demonstrations to public groups, volunteers, and technicians in the field. Learning techniques are the first step in being competitive in this field and it is a top priority of mine to break the barrier that restricts people from gaining these experiences. If you are interested in learning more about bird banding and its importance pleas see the links below. If you are in Florida, Wyoming, or Hawai'i and are interested in gaining more experience please reach out for more information. <br><br>
